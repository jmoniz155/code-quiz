# code-quiz


## Description
This is where I use my knowledge in HTML, CSS javascript/jQuery to build this Code Quiz game. It is played by answering multiple choice questions. If you answer the wrong question or take to long the timer runs out and the game is over. You are then able to log and save your initials and score.

## Function
This is a small game that that gives you 6 multiple choice questions that you must answer before the time runs out. There will be directions to the game before starting. Start by clicking the start button, then a timer will start to count down and you will be asked a question. When you answer the question you will be asked another question. Time will be subtracted if you answer the question incorrectly and when all questions are answered or the timer reaches zero the game is over. You will then beable to save your initials and score.

## Credits
* [Credits]
I would like to give credit to my Varsity Tutor for helping me understand how to use javascript building a code-quiz.  I have learned so much on this assignment. Really taking the time to explain how to read and understand the acceptance criteria to generate code and using google.
